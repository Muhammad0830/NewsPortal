This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

 after cloning the project from github, you need to install the dependencies by running the command
# npm install

after that, you need to create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following lines to it: (you can use my edgeStore keys for testing)

# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = "http://localhost:3001"

# EDGE_STORE_ACCESS_KEY=upmDg7cTz3fp7rK7edXWvNz8wAcvpG9I
# EDGE_STORE_SECRET_KEY=boR3TUx68V5mr4xCHWgGUH6Ur9KHTWKpif9QD5TcBrT00e8u

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
